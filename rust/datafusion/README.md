# DataFusion

DataFusion is an in-memory query engine that uses Apache Arrow as the memory model. It supports executing SQL queries against CSV and Parquet files as well as querying directly against in-memory data.

## Using DataFusion as a library

DataFusion can be used as a library by adding the following to your `Cargo.toml` file.

```toml
[dependencies]
datafusion = "2.0.0-SNAPSHOT"
```

## Using DataFusion as a binary

DataFusion includes a simple command-line interactive SQL utility. See the [CLI reference](docs/cli.md) for more information.

# Supported SQL

This library currently supports the following SQL constructs:

* `CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE X STORED AS PARQUET LOCATION '...';` to register a table's locations
* `SELECT ... FROM ...` together with any expression
* `ALIAS` to name an expression
* `CAST` to change types, including e.g. `Timestamp(Nanosecond, None)`
* most mathematical unary and binary expressions such as `+`, `/`, `sqrt`, `tan`, `>=`.
* `WHERE` to filter
* `GROUP BY` together with one of the following aggregations: `MIN`, `MAX`, `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`
* `ORDER BY` together with an expression and optional `ASC` or `DESC` and also optional `NULLS FIRST` or `NULLS LAST`

## Supported Data Types

DataFusion uses Arrow, and thus the Arrow type system, for query
execution. The SQL types from
[sqlparser-rs](https://github.com/ballista-compute/sqlparser-rs/blob/main/src/ast/data_type.rs#L57)
are mapped to Arrow types according to the following table


| SQL Data Type   | Arrow DataType                   |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `CHAR`          | `Utf8`                           |
